Hi, my name is Melania Headley. I go to the New Jersey Institute of Technology where I am pursing a Bachelors degree in Architecture. I like to play soccer, listen to music, and hangout with my friends.
I also like to paint and draw on my free time. Whenever I have time I like to sit by a building or a park and just draw what I see for fun.
